## Part 1:
**Top 5 List**

1. Most observed global warming is natural due to El Niño events.
* Why I rethought it: I know that the ENSO cycle (which include El Niño events) can cause global changes in temperature and precipitation.
2. Hurricane intensity has not gotten more intense over the past 170 years.
* Why I rethought it: They argued that data before 1972 (when satellite observation started) wasn’t reliable, and created new hurricane modelling to account for that.
3. pH changes to the ocean are miniscule and harmless as seawater is alkaline.
* Why I rethought it: They argued that the drop in pH from the 1750s to the present weren’t actually measured, but just modelled. 
4. Tornadoes are getting less severe.
* Why I rethought it: Their argument was that tornado geography was shifting but the actual severity was not.
5. Sea level rising trends haven’t changed in over 100 years.
* Why I rethought it: They used data from NOAA, which is a scientific government agency, to illustrate their point.

## Part 2:
**Claims Analysis**

According to [EverythingClimate.org](https://everythingclimate.org/el-nino/), most observed global warming is natural. They state that El Niño events are responsible for roughly half of all global warming in the 21st century (Everything Climate, 2021). Looking at global warming data from the period 2000 - 2018, Dr. Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama argued that the El Niño spike in 2015 - 2016 skewed the data (Everything Climate, 2021). His argument was that by removing that event from the data, UAH tropospheric temperature trend is negligible and the surface temperatures is nearly cut in half in comparison to the original model that included the El Niño spike (Everything Climate, 2021). Going even further, he states that if we negate the natural warming then the observed rate of warming is only half that projected by current climate models (Everything Climate, 2021). This point of view was said to be in response to “some climate scientists, politicians, activists, and various green energy pundits who go even further, behaving as if warming is 100% human-caused” (Everything Climate, 2021).

This article was particularly interesting to me because at first glance some of the information seemed correct. I knew that the ENSO cycle (which includes El Niño events) can cause global changes in temperature and precipitation, so I thought the article could definitely have some merit. However, once I read further into the article I knew it had to be incorrect because it essentially tries to belittle the contributions that humans make to climate change as well as dismisses the effects of climate change as nothing but a natural progression.
 
Using the application of the principles for evaluating information sources I was able to determine that this article was not very credible, accurate, logical, or plausible. First, the purpose of the article was clearly to discredit those who believe that human contributions to climate change is a concerning issue. It’s indented audience clearly wasn’t a very scientific one as there was very little real research or facts discussed, it was mostly an opinion piece with nothing to back it up. There is no author for this specific article nor is there an organization backing to up, however the research of Dr. Roy Spencer was used to justify the article. There are no references to support this viewpoint beyond Dr. Spencer’s research and no proper citations. Finally, the research was very biased and clearly contained opinion so it should not be used as a real source of information.

In addition, through research I was able to determine that this article was false. In my research, I found that ENSO (which encompasses El Niño and La Niña spikes) is actually the most dramatic annual cycle of the Earth’s climate system, and it affects everything from agriculture to public health to power generation (NOAA, 2020). Some of the negative effects of El Niños include extensive coral bleaching and increased tropical storm activity in the Pacific Ocean, both of which happened during the 2015 - 2016 El Niño spike (NOAA, 2020). Dr. Antonietta Capotondi, a CIRES scientist for NOAA's Physical Sciences Laboratory, has studied the effects of global warming on El Niño events and found that warming climates actually increase their frequency and shift their location more eastward (NOAA, 2020). This means that even though El Niño events are ‘natural’, they are processed by climate change and are still a huge concern.
